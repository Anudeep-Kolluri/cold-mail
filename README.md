# Cold Mail

Are you looking for an **IT** job? Then you are probably doomed. You are applying on LinkedIn and not getting any callbacks. You tried different job portals and still can't make any progress. What do you do now?

Introducing **"Cold Mail"**. Yeah, just cold mail... Does it guarantee you a job? No. But maybe it will help. Maybe. Or maybe it won't. But at least you’ll feel like you’re doing something, right?

## How to Use:

1. Click on an email you come across. (Yes, an email. That's the first step, believe it or not.)
2. Highlight it and right-click on it. (You’re still clicking, so that's progress!)
3. Click on **"Cold Mail"**. (Congratulations, you've made it this far.)
4. This should direct you to Gmail with pre-filled data. (A small victory. Maybe. Or maybe it's just another empty inbox.)

Hope at least this will help you find a job. Maybe. Or maybe you’ll just send a bunch of emails into the void, never to hear from anyone. Who knows? The world is a mystery.
